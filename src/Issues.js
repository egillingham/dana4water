                        <h2 className="featurette-heading">Develop cost-effective local supplies to decrease reliance on expensive imported water and lessen rate impacts to customers</h2>
                        <p className="lead">On average, 67% of the District’s water supply is imported from northern California and the Colorado River. The remainder is local supply from Hodges Reservoir (29%) and water recycling (4%). The cost to purchase imported water supplies has more than doubled over the past ten years and will continue to increase in the years to come. This is the District’s most expensive supply and has a direct impact on the District’s budget and customer’s water rates.</p>
                        <p className="lead">The solution is to invest in a cost-effective local supply alternative, such as potable reuse, that reduces reliance on imported supplies, provides more long-term certainty and lessens rate impacts to customers. A potable reuse project uses proven water purification technology to clean recycled wastewater to produce a safe, high-quality supply of drinking water. The Cities of San Diego and Oceanside, as well as a partnership of agencies in east San Diego County are pursing advanced purification projects to reduce their reliance on expensive imported supplies. If elected to the Board, I will advocate for the District to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of this option, in cooperation with the other water and wastewater agencies in North San Diego County.</p>

                        <p className="lead">Lake Hodges Dam is owned and operated by the City of San Diego, with a portion of the storage allocated to the District. The Dam is more than 100 years old and as with any piece of aging infrastructure, the materials that make up the dam have deteriorated to a point that repairs are now required. The California Division of Safety of Dams has restricted the elevation of the water storage in the reservoir to maintain safety of the dam. The Division of Safety of Dams supports continued operation of the reservoir at this restricted level. Due to these actions, the District’s available storage pool has been reduced.</p>
                        <p className="lead">Lake Hodges serves as an important local source of water for the District. It is also the District’s lowest cost water. The City of San Diego is currently conducting an analysis of alternatives for long-term remediation/replacement of the Dam that could allow for restoration of the allowable reservoir levels. As a Board member I will advocate that alternative solutions clearly identify the long-term supply benefits and cost implications for the District’s ratepayers. All options for use of the reservoir must also be considered, including potentially storing purified recycled water that could be part of any future potential potable reuse project.</p>

                        <p className="lead">In May 2018, a state law was passed that mandates each urban water supplier in California to comply with a long-term water-use efficiency objective by 2023, or potentially face financial penalties. State regulatory agencies are currently developing outdoor and indoor water use standards that will be used to calculate each urban water supplier’s individual objective, including a water-use objective for the District. The District will compare actual water use to the objective to determine compliance.</p>
                        <p className="lead">In the next year or two, the District will need to begin developing a plan outlining how it will achieve the water-use objective established for the District. The plan must be developed with input from the community, account for those customers that are already efficient and focus on wasteful water-use practices.</p>

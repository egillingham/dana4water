                        <p className="lead">Create an affordable locally sustainable water supply portfolio for our community. A portfolio that will include cost-effective local supply projects, such as potable reuse, to reduce reliance on expensive imported supplies, provide more long-term cost certainty and lessens rate impacts to customers. Future water rates must also continue to be fair and equitable to the rate payers of Solana Beach. In the Districtâ€™s budgeting process, savings should be achieved through cost efficiencies and not just deferral of projects and programs. Decision making at the District must be conducted in an open and transparent manner, ensuring that the community has ample opportunity to provide input on actions that could impact their water rates and supply reliability.</p>
